# Trend-Detection-Exercise-
Detecting trends for e-commerce reviews 

This was a short exercise that was done as an extra credit assingment for Georgia Tech's CSE6040 Intro to Computing for Data Analysis Course. 

This notebook analyzes a dataset containing over 6,000 reviews left my women via an e-commerce clothing website. The aim of the notebook is to see if there are recurring keywords or phrases amongst the items that will allow us to see what the top trends according to this website are. The benefit of this exersice is that it can be built upon using larger datasets from fashion magazines,social media posts, and comments, etc. that cater to a specific target consumer audience.

I set up this project as a starter for a larger project that I wish to implement which detects fashion trends since my partner and I would like to start up a social enterprise that matches disadvantages artisans to consumers living in developed regions. For such an endeavour, market research is crucial and instead of reading or skimming through thousands of posts and articles, it would be helpful to pick out key, relevant phrases.
